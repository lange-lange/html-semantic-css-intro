/* #2. internal which overides the inline

/* CSS is made up of declaring blocks, rules that cascade to change one instance or multiple instances of styles. it's the sprinkles on a ice cream cone. the sauce of a taco. it can also be a great way to position elements on multiple pages consistently and programatically. it's powerful, you can even draw shapes with CSS.

1. ID vs 
2. CLASS

1. id: a pound key or hashtag in front denotes an ID, which can only appear once on a page, helpful for anchor/jump links on the same page.

#id {
    property: value;
}

2. class: a period in front denotes a class. replace .class with any selector as long as it is defined in your html too.

.class {
    property: value;
    property: value;
    property: value;
}


note padding is super weird on CSS.
ref: https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css_padding.asp
for example in: 

padding: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
        
        top padding is 25px
        right padding is 50px
        bottom padding is 75px
        left padding is 100px

therefore, use the padding shorthand property with four values:

div {
  padding: [top]px [right]px [bottom]px [left]px;
}

    <h3 id="trouble">The trouble with HTML and CSS</h3>
    <blockquote>Some of the trouble with HTML and CSS lies with the fact that both languages are fairly simple, and often developers don't take them seriously, in terms of making sure the code is well-crafted, efficient, and semantically describes the purpose of the features on the page. In the worst cases, JavaScript is used to generate the entire web page content and style, which makes your pages inaccessible, and less performant (generating DOM elements is expensive). In other cases, nascent features are not supported consistently across browsers, which can make some features and styles not work for some users. Responsive design problems are also common — a site that looks good in a desktop browser might provide a terrible experience on a mobile device, because the content is too small to read, or perhaps the site is slow because of expensive animations.</blockquote>

        <h3 id="codingtolearn">Coding to Learn vs Learning to Code</h3>

    <p>Coding to Learn is all about reading the documentation. Be patient. Be methodological. Learn how to learn, by troubleshooting with a peer, and trying it yourself through trial and error. If you're struggling, review the Coding Tips PDF. The blessing and the curse of creative coding is that there will be a half-dozen different ways to accomplish a goal. Be open to <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/what-screens-want/" target="_blank">flux</a>, change, and surprise. If you're open to it: there can often be joy and delight too. Overcoming challenges can be fulfilling.
    <blockquote>Fundamentally, creativity is a question of time. Mostly of our daily activity with computers happens through hopefully speedy but ossified software. We use the computer in “speedrun mode.”19 This is the paradox of creative coding: the coding part is supposed to make things faster, the creative part requires that things go slowly.</blockquote>

            <li><b>relative</b></li>
            <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. <span style="color:grey">Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element <i>will</i> cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.</span> Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. For an example: scroll down to <a href="#example2">Figure. 2: Relative.</a>
            </p>

            <li><b>fixed</b></li>
            <p>An example of position fixed is the back to top button, positioned in the bottom right of your viewport. <span style="color:grey">Use with caution as these can be annoying, when you take up too much of the user's viewport.</span></p>

            <li><b>absolute</b></li>
            <p><span style="color:grey">Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements</span>. <span style="color:red">Use with caution! However they are useful when positioned <i>within a relative container</i></span>.
                
            </p>
            <li><b>sticky</b></li>
            <p>An example of position sticky is the on-page navigation on this page. It sticks with you as you scroll, until the next element that was positioned sticky comes into view. <span style="color:grey">Note: Similar to fixed, use with caution as these can be annoying when you take up too much of the user's viewport.</span></p>
